These instructions describe how to install or update firmware on your Bakiwi and also enable you to install a self-written program.

== Clone the Repository
Clone the repository or get it via Github's download button:
****
`git clone https://github.com/ku3i/bakiwi`
****

This step requires `git`. If you're on a Linux machine, you probably have `git` already installed. You can test this by opening a terminal and typing `git --version`. If `git` is not yet installed and you want to install it, type:
****
`sudo apt-get install git`
****

== Installing the Arduino IDE

Open a Browser, navigate to the following link and download the latest version of the Arduino IDE (tested with 1.8.12):
****
`https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software`
****

Start the IDE and open the `preferences` dialog. Add the following link to `Additional Boards Manager URLs`:
****
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json`
****

Then select `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager` and seach for `attiny`. Install the `Attiny Support Library by Davis A. Mellis`.

When the installation was succesfull open the `source/bakiwi_kit/so2walk_tiny/so2walk_tiny.ino` file via `File -> Open` dialog and setup the Attiny84 processor in `Tools` accordingly as described in the picture:

* Board: *ATtiny24/44/84*
* Processor: *ATtiny84*
* Clock: *Internal 8 MHz*
* Programmer: *Arduino as ISP* (if using a Bakiwi-ISP)

If you have set up the processor, select `Sketch -> Verify/Compile` and if the code could be successfully compiled, connect the Bakiwi-Programmer to your computer via USB cable and to your Bakiwi via the 6-pin ISP connector (pay attention to the polarity).

Then select `Sketch -> Upload` and the programmer should now start to flash the LEDs for some seconds. After that, remove the 6-pin ISP connector.

The Bakiwi-Firmware should now be installed.

== Install AVR Toolchain
Your Bakiwi is always delivered with the latest firmware. However, if you want to use a brand new ATTiny84, the fuses must first be set. The following commands do exactly this and cause the LEDs to flash as a success message. You can also use the minimal program as a starting point for your own firmware development if you do not want to use the Arduino IDE or the Arduino framework.

Make sure you have a minimal AVR toolchain installed (Linux).
****
`sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc avrdude`
****

Navigate to the folder `source/blinky`:
****
`cd source/bakiwi_kit/blinky`
****

Then build, test and install the Bakiwi's Helloworld (blinky) program by typing:
****
`make`

`make test`

`make install`
****

This sets the fuses of the ATtiny84 and causes the LEDs to flash at a rate of around 1 Hz. If the fuses are once set, and you're not going to change them, you can also only flash the program without further touching the fuses:
****
`make flash`
****
